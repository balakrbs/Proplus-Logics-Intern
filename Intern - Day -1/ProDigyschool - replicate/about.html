            Welcome to Prodigy International Montessori School, where learning
            is a joyous adventure! Our name, “Prodigy,” derives from the Latin
            word “Prodigium,” which denotes a person or child with exceptional
            talent. Here at Prodigy, we believe that every child is
            extraordinary and deserving of special attention. Since our
            establishment on October 3rd, 2014, we have been a nurturing haven
            for young talents, where their uniqueness is recognized and
            celebrated.
          </p>
          <p class="fs-6">
            As a certified educational institution by Montessori International
            (AMI), we uphold their esteemed standards throughout our campus. Our
            teacher-to-student ratio follows AMI guidelines, with one teacher
            dedicated to every fifteen children, ensuring personalized attention
            and care. To further enrich the learning experience, we exclusively
            appoint Montessori-certified teachers who are adept at employing
            advanced teaching methodologies.
          </p>

          <p class="fs-6">
            At Prodigy, we embrace the saying,
            <span class="text-black-50 fw-bold"
              >“Stay true to yourself. An original is worth more than a
              copy,”</span
            >
            spoken by Suzy Kassem. We cherish the diverse abilities, strengths,
            and weaknesses of each student, fostering an environment that
            celebrates their individuality. Our focus is on holistic child
            development, empowering them to explore, experiment, and learn
            independently, thereby nurturing their confidence.
          </p>
          <p class="fs-6">
            To cater to the needs of our young scholars, we have a dedicated
            snack corner where they can enjoy treats at any time of the day.
            Additionally, our day-care services are managed by trained
            caretakers, ensuring that your child is in the best hands. Our
            well-equipped kitchen features a microwave and refrigerator,
            ensuring that children feel right at home.

              “Give the world to the small child”.- Maria Montessori.
            </h3>
            <p>
              “Give the world to the small child,” the wise words of Maria
              Montessori resonate deeply at Prodigy. We believe that children at
              a young age possess an insatiable curiosity, a boundless wonder
              for every little thing they encounter. Whether it’s the green
              grass under their tiny feet, the muddy soil they gleefully
              explore, or the gentle raindrops that dance on their outstretched
              palms, they find joy in everything around them. Maria Montessori’s
              revolutionary education methods sought to offer these young minds
              the entire world to explore and embrace.
            </p>
            <p>
              At Prodigy, we wholeheartedly embrace this vision, providing our
              children with a nurturing environment where they can learn,
              cherish, and delight in the wonders of life. Also, we strive to
              create an enriching world where every child’s imagination knows no
              bounds, where they can flourish and revel in the magic of
              learning.

              The primary goal of education is to cultivate independent
              thinkers. When we simply provide our children with monotonous
              learning and rote memorization without fostering understanding,
              they miss out on the opportunity to develop as independent
              thinkers. At Prodigy, we prioritize enabling children to learn on
              their own. We encourage them to comprehend concepts and think
              critically. Our approach empowers children to grow independently
              and embrace the motto, “Help me to do it myself.” Through
              practical sessions and workshops, we actively involve our children
              in social interactions. These experiences equip them with the
              skills necessary for independence.

            <p>
              This type of education focuses on equipping children with life
              skills from an early stage of life. It is significantly different
              from the traditional method of learning as it employs hands-on
              techniques. At Prodigy, we follow the Montessori methods, which
              encompass a wide range of diverse activities. Students have the
              freedom to choose any subject they desire to learn on any given
              day. Our classrooms are designed to be child-friendly, allowing
              children to engage in various forms of learning, such as language,
              math, science, music, dance, and more. Through this approach, they
              develop self-discipline, responsibility, and outgoingness. The
              Montessori methods empower them to acquire essential skills to
              navigate everyday life successfully. We strive to prepare them for
              a bright future from a young age.

              <p>
                In the quaint town of Chiaravalle, Italy, a young girl named
                Maria Montessori was born with a heart full of empathy and
                dreams beyond the confines of tradition. Raised in a time when
                women’s roles were limited, Maria’s desire to become an engineer
                surprised her father, who expected her to follow the
                conventional path of Latin, Literature, and homemaking.
                Undeterred, Maria enrolled at a boys technical school, excelling
                in math and engineering studies at Regio Instituto Tecnico
                Leonardoda da Vinci. She earned a degree in physics-mathematics
                in 1890.
              </p>

              <p>
                However, her thirst for knowledge knew no bounds, and Maria took
                a bold step to study medicine at the University of Rome, an
                unthinkable endeavor for a woman in those days. Despite facing
                prejudice and dissection classes done in solitude, Maria’s
                unwavering determination led her to become one of the first
                female doctors in the country in July 1896. Her journey took her
                to Santo Spirito Hospital in Rome, where she embraced her
                humanitarian nature by tending to the needs of children with
                special needs, yearning for them to have the best in life.
              </p>
              <p>
                Maria’s passion for education soon took center stage as she
                addressed various medical conferences, advocating for better
                educational methods for all children. Her keen observations
                while working at the Orthopherenic school and her belief in
                hands-on learning fuelled her desire to develop a curriculum
                that nurtured children’s sensory perception and motor skills.
                She envisioned an environment where children could explore,
                learn, and educate themselves through auto-education.

                The child gives us a beautiful lesson – that in order to form
                and maintain our intelligence, we must use our hands.- Maria
                Montessori.
              </p>

              <p>
                Maria’s innovative methods struck a chord and gained global
                recognition, with her ideas spreading like wildfire. In 1909,
                she began training teachers with Montessori methods, and her
                book became a beacon for education worldwide, embraced
                particularly by the Americans. In 1929, she founded the
                Association Montessori Internationale (AMI) to carry her legacy
                forward.
              </p>
              <p>
                Despite facing the rise of fascism, Maria’s determination to
                make a difference persisted, leading her to the faraway land of
                India. There, she encountered great minds like Gandhi, Nehru,
                and Tagore, leaving an indelible mark on the educational
                landscape. In the vibrant city of Chennai, Maria continued to
                inspire minds, dedicating herself to the mission of AMI.
              </p>
              <p>
                Her incredible journey came to an end on May 6, 1952, but her
                family and organization continue to carry her legacy, working
                passionately for AMI and the future of education. Maria
                Montessori’s story is one of breaking barriers, compassion, and
                a visionary spirit that transformed the world of education
                forever. Her love for humanity and dedication to being a teacher
                continue to inspire generations, reminding us that one heart,
                one dream, and one vision can change the course of history.

              <p class="card-text fw-light py-3">
                Every human being deserves to be loved and respected, regardless
                of their age and gender. One of the important principles at
                Prodigy is giving respect to every child. Here at Prodigy, we do
                not keep anyone as the focal point, so children can move with
                ease among everyone, including the educator. One of the most
                important things the educator at Prodigy would do is to respect
                the child, allowing the child to naturally learn kindness,
                courtesy, thoughtfulness, and compassion from the educator. This
                will help the child develop positive relationships with everyone
                in general. In Montessori classrooms, teachers respect children
                as separate and unique individuals. They guide children to
                respect the people and objects in their environment, and as the
                child grows older, to respect and understand the connectedness
                between all living and non-living things, leading to the
                adolescent’s profound awareness of the complex web of human
                existence.

                The environment at Montessori is called as Prepared environment
                as it is specifically designed for the needs of children. It has
                designs to enable the children to have independent learning. The
                furnitures, shelves and study materials are designed in a way
                which can be handled by a child without the help of an adult. We
                have open space where the child can choose to sit anywhere and
                work with the mat Or the small table and chairs. The environment
                has minimal colors and natural taste to it.In Montessori
                classrooms, teachers respect children as separate and unique
                individuals. They guide children to respect the people and

                Mankind is gifted with creativity. Imagination is the basis for
                an individual to become creative. At Prodigy many activities are
                designed in such a way to develop the creativity in children.
                The open-ended experiments are such an example where the
                children uses imagination. This kind of educational experiment
                will produce innovative thinkers.

              <p class="card-text fw-light py-3">
                At Prodigy, we embrace Montessori methods to empower our
                children with the invaluable gift of freedom of choice. Within
                our carefully crafted environment, they are encouraged to select
                activities that resonate with their interests and passions. With
                each decision they make, they also gain first-hand experience of
                its consequences, fostering a deep understanding of cause and
                effect. This freedom not only liberates their spirits but also
                equips them with the clarity and confidence to make sound
                decisions independently. It also develops the sense of
                responsibility in them. Freedom is frequently misunderstood, and
                many people take it to mean that children can do whatever they
                want. Montessori believed that freedom without boundaries was
                abandonment. In Montessori classrooms, expectations are clear,
                and children experience the natural and logical consequences of
                their choices. This freedom within limits allows for the natural
                development of self-regulation within the society of the
                classroom, as well as mirroring behaviours expected by society
                in general.
